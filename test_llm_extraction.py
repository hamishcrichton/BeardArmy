        "description": """Watch as I attempt to eat the biggest pizza in Las Vegas at Super Mario's Italian Restaurant! This massive 45-inch pizza challenge is one of the most epic food challenges I've ever attempted. Located in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, Super Mario's is known for their huge portions and this pizza lives up to the hype.

The challenge rules are simple: finish the entire 45-inch pizza in under 2 hours to get your name on the wall of fame and win $500. Very few people have ever completed this monster pizza challenge.

Unfortunately, I couldn't finish this one - the sheer volume was just too much even for me! Came close though.
