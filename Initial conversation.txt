Hey there! Thanks for getting in touch! Give me a moment, I'll be right with you.

Hi Veljko. I'm writing to understand whether there's any flexibility in the early exit fees.
My partner is a doctor who has just been allocated a mandatory role in Newcastle, so we have to relocate at short notice. Unfortunately, your service isn't available at our new address, so we can't transfer the contract.Since this move is completely out of our control - it's a required medical assignment that we can't refuse - I was hoping you might be able to waive the early exit fee as a goodwill gesture. We've been happy customers and would definitely use your services again if we ever move somewhere you provide coverage.I can provide documentation of the medical assignment if you need it to support this request.

Would it perhaps help if the new owners of our current flat take on Hyperoptic?

I just double-checked and I can confirm that we can waive early termination fee once the new owners make an account with us

Fantastic! What does the process look like for that?

So, the new owners can give us a call and make an account with us with the assistace of our sales team, and once that is settled, you can give us a call and we can proceed with the next step, terminating your account
Understood- thanks! Could I ask you to pop that in an email for us, please?

If that's everything, I wish you a nice day.
